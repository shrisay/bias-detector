            From the design of this webpage, to the fine-tuning of the AI model behind it, this full-stack application has been built by a single student in high school.
            As an avid participant in Model United Nations conferences, I have spent countless hours researching numerous world issues. I came to the realization that news articles are biased more often than one might think, subtly attempting to steer their readers towards a certain ideology.<br><br>
            Then I wondered: what if there was a way for me to detect bias or the ever-frustrating clickbait in an article without ever reading it?
            Machine Learning has been a topic of my fascination for a while, and this project seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn and apply its concepts.
            Combining my skills from Harvard's CS50 Web, introductory ML courses on Kaggle and a little help from my older sister, I have built this webpage using Python's Django framework and JavaScript for interactive features (such as toggling dark mode).<br><br>
            <strong>For further information on the AI model and the working of this project, visit the <a href="">How it Works</a> section.</strong>
